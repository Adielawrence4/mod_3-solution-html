          <h2>Cardiovascular system</h2>
          The cardiovascular system (CVS) is basically a closed vehicle transport system. This system provides a mechanism by which blood in vessels circulates through body tissues. In circulating blood, the CVS provides a link between the external environment and tissues. By this, the CVS supply oxygen and digested nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to body tissues and also removes carbon dioxide and other waste from tissues for excretion either through the lungs, kidneys, skin etc.
  As blood circulate through the tissues, hormones, antibodies and other defense components are distributed as needed for homeostasis, and circulating blood also assist in temperature regulation.
  The cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood vessels. The heart is an incessant muscular pump, it pumps blood through a series of vessels (aorta, artery, arterioles, capillaries, venules, veins and vena cavae), the smallest of which is the capillaries and are suitable for exchange between blood and body tissues. The cardiovascular system is also called the circulatory
  In man, the heart is a four chambered muscular pump; it consists of the right and the left atrial, the right and the left ventricles. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and the left ventricles pumps it to all parts of the body via the aorta for the supply of oxygenated blood to the tissues.
  The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body via the vena cavae and the right ventricle pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary artery. 
The left chamber starts the systemic circulation or the major circulation and it has thicker walls than the right ventricles. The right chamber of the heart starts the pulmonary circulation or the lesser circulation. The third circulation is called lymphatic circulation. The lymphatic circulation starts from the interstitial spaces as lymph, it is carried via the lymphatic vessels and empties into the systemic circulation via the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct, from here they enter the left and right subclavian veins and then emptied into the left and right jugular veins of their respective sides.
Guarding the openings between the atrial and ventricles are atrioventricular valves (A-V) valves. The valve between the atria and ventricles has 3 cups and it is called the tricuspid valve or A-V valve while the semilunar valve has two cups and it is called the bicuspid valve. AV valves open when the pressure in the atrial exceeds the ventricular pressure and closed when the reverse occurs. Also guarding the exits from the ventricles and the aorta are semi-lunar valves. They usually open when the pressure in the ventricles exceeds that in their connecting vessels. 
  The heart muscle is cross-striated, the myofibrils branch and interdigitate. The junctional membrane between two myofibrils are parallel to each other and fuse end-to-end over an extensive series of folds to form intercalated Discs, 175Å. They provide a strong union between myofibrils, maintaining cell to cell cohesion longitudinally ensuring that the pull of one contractile myofibril is faithfully transmitted along its axis to the next.
  Also, along the sides of the myofibrils, adjacent to the discs, cell membrane of adjacent fibrils fuse for considerable distances, 20 Å, these are called longitudinal fusion areas (LFA). The LFA together with discs provide a low resistance bridge for the spread of excitation from one myofibrils to the next. This is why cardiac muscles function as a syncytium (i.e. as if all the myofibrils constituted one myofibril).
  Cardiac muscle is said to have an inherent myocardial rhythmicity automaticity. This is because certain cardiac tissues are able to initiate rhythmic depolarization and subsequent heart beats. The system is composed of the sino-atrial node (SAN), the atrio-ventricular node (AVN), the bundle of His, Purkinje fibrils and the network of Purkinje system within the ventricular myocardium.
Properties of the excitatroy/conductive fibers
  SAN fires action potential at the rate of 70-100 time per minute
  AVN fires at the rate of 40-60 time per minute
  Purkinje fibers at 20-40 time per minute
The resting membrane potential of the SNA is -60Mv
That of the ANV is -80Mv while that of Purkinje cells is -90 to -100Mv.
  The high rate of excitation and the high resting membrane potential of SAN make it function as the cardiac pace maker. When SAN is diseased other tissue of the heart takes other the pace maker function of the heart but the heart rate slows down.
